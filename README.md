# lunar-oblique-impact-ejecta
This repository includes input files for iSALE-3D and the simulations results of ejecta launch velocities, launch angles, and ejecta deposit patterns. Please note the iSALE-3D code is distributed on a case-by-case basis in the impact community, restricted to non-commercial use. Post-processing scripts incorporated the pySALEPlot tool written by Tom Davison.
